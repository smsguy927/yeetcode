# Problem Statement
Find the country with the largest combined population by   
joining the given data on foreign keys

The output of largestCountry should be an object with a   
key 'name' representing the country name and a key 'population'   
representing the countries total population   

 ### Example   

 Input Data:
 ```js   
 const countries = [
   { id: 3, name: 'Russia' },
   { id: 1, name: 'USA' },
 ];

 const cities = [
   { id: 3, country_id: 1, name: 'Los Angeles' },
   { id: 8, country_id: 3, name: 'Moscow' },
   { id: 2, country_id: 1, name: 'Seattle' },
 ];

 const populations = [
   { id: 1, city_id: 3, amount: 3960000 },
   { id: 2, city_id: 8, amount: 11920000 },
   { id: 3, city_id: 2, amount: 8240000 },
 ];
```

 Output:   
 ```js
 {name: 'USA', population: 12200000 }


const largestCountry = (countries, cities, populations) => {

  return { name: country, population: countryPopulation };
};

```
